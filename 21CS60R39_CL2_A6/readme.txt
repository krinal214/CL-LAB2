1) run query in order as output of previous query may be used in later queries.
   query1 --> query2--->query3--->query4

2) output format:
   query1: employee_id \t no_of_mails
   query2: employee_id \t no_of_mails for top 10 
   query3: employee_id \t no_of_employees 
   query4: department_id \t no_of_mails

3)I have put network.txt and dept_labels.txt in all the query folders. 

4)In my ubuntu system, i have to use python3 to execute the python code.
If it doesn't work in your system then kindly replace with python or connect with me.
